# Viacom Social Targeting Pricing Model
Viacom is home to the worldâ€™s premier entertainment brands, including MTV, Comedy Central, and Nickelodeon, that connect with audiences through compelling content across television, motion picture, online and mobile platforms in over 160 countries and territories.

Viacom monetizes its social presence by creating custom branded content for advertisers that get published on Viacoms social channels. The company is interested in deploying a new pricing strategy to take advatage of accrued value that Viacom offers to its advertisers. Some questions must be answered by the projects are:
- Can demographic targeting provide value to Viacom's partner advertisers that Viacom can capitalize on?
- How can the company leverage the demographic information provided by digital and social channels in order to establish and optimize ad costs charged to Viacom partner advertisers? 
- Would such digital targeting be viable, and if so, to what degree a possible marketplace differentiator if implemented? 

The project is the most primitive way to price an advertising contract using demographic data. By using this model, Viacom can understand how different pages perform for each different customers and how Viacom can manipulate the model to reap more profit.
